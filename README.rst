eventloop: Abstraction layer for filesystem events
==================================================

Eventloop uses any of: `pyuv` or `PySide2` or `PyQt5` installed in the system 
to provide uniform callback interface for filesystem events. And also timers.

Package intended to be a building block for utility scripts for recompiling 
or pushing files or restarting tests.

`pyuv` is used preferably as it's most efficient. `uv` is a library that 
powers nodejs event loop. Imagine you can `fs.watch` in python. No need to 
imagine, you can.

Installing
==========

eventloop can be installed via pip as follows:

::

    pip install eventloop

Usage
=====

In simple case you can use `on_file_changed` decorator. It creates event loop, system watch and schedule, then connects them, then starts the loop and calls decorated function on filesystem events.

.. code-block:: python

    from eventloop import on_file_changed

    if __name__ == "__main__":

        @on_file_changed("/path/to/dir")
        def your_handler(file_path):
            print(file_path)

Decorator accepts `include` and `exclude` args (list of globs or names to include or exclude files from watch) and `timeout` arg (read about timeout below) and `loop` arg.

If you need to watch more than one path you need to create and start `EventLoop` explicitly and pass it to decorators.

.. code-block:: python

    from eventloop import EventLoop, on_file_changed

    if __name__ == "__main__":

        loop = EventLoop()

        @on_file_changed("/path/to/first/dir", loop=loop)
        def first_handler(file_path):
            print(file_path)

        @on_file_changed("/path/to/second/dir", loop=loop)
        def second_handler(file_path):
            print(file_path)

        loop.start()

For finer control over things you can use classes, first example can be rewriten as

.. code-block:: python

    from eventloop import EventLoop, FileSystemWatch, Schedule, base

    class Executor(base.Executor):
        def execute(self, file_path):
            print(file_path)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        loop = EventLoop()
        def on_change(file_path, event):
            schedule.append(file_path, timeout=1)
        watch = FileSystemWatch()
        watch.start("/path/to/dir", on_change)
        executor = Executor()
        schedule = Schedule(executor)
        loop.start()

`Schedule` caches (deduplicates) tasks appended within `timeout` interval, so for example three immediate consecutive `changed` events on same file end up in just one `Executor.execute(task)` call. `on_file_changed` decorator also uses `Schedule` to cache events.
